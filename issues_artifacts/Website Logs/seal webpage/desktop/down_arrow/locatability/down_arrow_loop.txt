['tools that aid with the construction, analysis, and maintenance of large-scale dependable software ']
['systems. The inherent complexity of large-scale software systems has always posed a significant ']
['challenge to software practitioners. On top of this, emerging non-conventional computing domains ']
['(e.g., autonomic, embedded, pervasive, and mobile systems) present developers with a formidable set ']
['of new challenges. The overarching hypothesis guiding this research lab is that it is possible to ']
['reduce the complexity of engineering dependable software by automating the cumbersome manual ']
['software engineering activities.\n']

['In that context, the members of the lab to date have investigated a wide range of issues, which can ']
['be roughly categorized into three research thrusts:\n']
